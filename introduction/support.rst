Community Support
-----------------

Helix TOolkit has a small community that may help you out if you have questions. If you can't find your answer in the documentation, you can...

- Ask your question on the `forum <http://forum.helix-toolkit.org/>`_. This is a good idea if you have multiple questions or a question that might have a more subjective answer (e.g., "recommendations" sorts of things).
- You can also try `StackOverflow <http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/helix-3d-toolkit>`_. Be sure to use the ``helix-3d-toolkit`` tag in your question.
