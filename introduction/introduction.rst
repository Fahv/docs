Helix Toolkit is an open source 3D library that is licensed under the MIT license. The MIT license is very permissive and permits use in proprietary software.

The library is based on .NET and is currently focusing on the WPF platform.

The goal has been to make it easy to work with 3D in WPF, and also provide features that are not included in the standard WPF 3D visual model.
